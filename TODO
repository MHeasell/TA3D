_improve A.I.
_D3D support

* 3DMEditor now supports OBJ 3D format
* 3DMEditor's interface has been rewritten
* rendering unit orders paths is faster (uses ARRAYs instead of immediate mode :s)
* in tactical view path icons are replaced with half transparent white lines (faster and visible :) )
* improved pathfinding and path following code performance
* improved global renderer performance
* support for available unit types detection (networking mode)
* added support for Damage categories (not supported in TA, but doesn't break compatibility)
* added a backtrace module to log the call stack state after a crash (Linux only :'( )
* added support for Internet Server list
* multiplayer :)

* added shootall console command to kill all enemy units
* low level networking layer uses HawkNL library
* added support for broadcasting (LAN server discovery)
* added networking code
* added support for mission features (features described in *.ota files)
* added a test to prevent making textures that can't fit within the maximum texture size available on the OpenGL renderer (hope it'll fix the SIS bug)

bug list
--------
_invisible units should be visible when an enemy is close enough
_sometimes weapons go through their target without hitting them !!
_There should be either restriction to use 12-icon build menu on resolutions lesser than 1024x768 or it should be sizeable, since now on 800x600 or 640x480 size of 12-icon build menu don`t match size of othe GUI parts and covers some of function buttons.
_AI still can`t place metal extractors directly where it should be placed
_add a flag to movement data to make units leaving their factory face the exit before moving
_some parts of the maps might not be drawn (visibility limit) like hills
_slow down with lots of 3D sprites on some gfx hardware (speed increased but bug not yet fixed)
_fix all other bugs ( :-) )

* fixed very ugly bug that could allow a unit to acquire a wrong target if the target has died and been replaced in memory before the mission is executed !
* fixed units being spawned not being cleared correctly from yard map
* fixed unit colors being wrong when texture cache is enabled
* fixed nanospray sometimes going to space
* fixed crash in Config->Audio when clicking something with no music listed
* fixed lots of bugs in networking code
* fixed some transparency drawing bugs with trees
* fixed tactical icons hidden by map geometry
* fixed some bugs in networking code
* fixed click on hidden widgets when floatting menus are unrolled
* enable ATI workarounds with SIS cards
* fixed gui bug with floatting menus : "when the pointer is over a floatting menu, it selects without clicking (config menu) ..."
* fixed : the second mission of arm campaign is no more won immediately ...

idea list
---------
_random map generator
_animated background in menus
_first person view to allow FPS style mods
