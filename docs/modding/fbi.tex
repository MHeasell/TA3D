Tags can be of several types:
\begin{itemize}
 \item integers
 \item decimal numbers
 \item booleans (1/0 or true/false)
 \item strings
\end{itemize}
When an integer is expect and you provide a decimal number, only the integer part is read.

\subsubsection{Acceleration}
The unit acceleration, can be a decimal number. Expressed in $pixel/s^2$.

\subsubsection{ActivateWhenBuilt}
I's a boolean. When set to true, the unit is ACTIVATED (or ON) when built.

\subsubsection{altfromsealevel}
It's an integer. Altitude from sea. For flying units.

\subsubsection{amphibious}
It's a boolean.
Is the unit amphibious (can go under water, \& on land).

\subsubsection{antiweapons}
It's a boolean. Set to true if your unit can shoot at weapons of other units (eg. Missile defence systems).

\subsubsection{attackrunlength}
It's an integer.
For planes. The distance they must travel before being able to drop their bombs/shoot their missiles.

\subsubsection{BMcode}
It's a boolean. false for buildings, true for mobile units.

\subsubsection{BadTargetCategory}
A list of 
The type of target that is not good for that low accuracy at this type of unit. In general.  The value specified identifies all units that have that value specified in their own "Category" settings. 	BadTargetCategory=VTOL;

BankScale 	The Scale (see Scale) of the unit when banking (ie. turning if its an aircraft) 	BankScale=1;
BrakeRate 	The rate at which the unit can slow down 	BrakeRate=9;

Category 	A category class. Look at some of the FBI files in totala1.hpi for examples.  Essentially, this places the unit in several named catagories that can be named in other variables such as "wpri\_badTargetCategory" described below, and in the AI Text files as well. 	Category=ARM TANK LEVEL2 CONSTR NOWEAPON NOTAIR NOTSUB CTRL\_B;
CloakCost 	The energy cost of this unit remaining cloaked when standing still. 	CloakCost=7;

Corpse 	The name of the corpse of this unit (Defined in the TDF file in the corpses directory)  (12/29/98)  From Draconious:  The name of the feature the unit turns into when the unit dies. If the unit is a feature (Dragons Teeth) the unit instantly turns into this feature, when it is finished being built. (this is not the 3do file of the feature, the feature entry tells the 3do file to use in the feautres OBJECT variable). 	Corpse=fortification\_core;
cruisealt 	The altitude at which the unit flys 	cruisealt=90;
DamageModifier 	The rate at which this unit heals itself. 	DamageModifier=0.7;

Description 	The description of the unit seen at the bottom of the screen when you hold the cursor over it in the game. 	Description=Very Heavy Assault Tank;
Designation 	The designation. This is unimportant and can have virtually any value (there may be a limit to the number of character it will except) 	Designation=WB-S;
digger 	Does this unit have pieces which extend under ground.  I think thats what it means. Things like the pop-up heavy cannon have this = 1. 	digger=1;
Downloadable 	Is this a unit which has been downloaded off the internet. If you want to be able to use the unit, put 1.

(12/28/98)  Note from The Raptor:  Not true. I've never included this variable in all of my units, and they work just fine. It's just one that we started seeing in the Cavedog weekly units, so assumed that's what it meant. It really seems to do nothing.

MoveRate1 	Planes seem to use this. For example, all planes except the air transports have values of 8, the transports have values of 1. 	MoveRate1=1;
MovementClass 	How the unit moves. See totala1.hpi for examples.   Movement classes are typically described in TDF files in the gamedata directory.  (The moveinfo.tdf file is a good guess).  It is used as a shortcut way of setting certain parameters (such as those listed here) by grouping them and giving them a name. 	MovementClass=TANKSH3;
Name 	The name you see when you move the cursor over the unit in the game.  This is the name that appears on the bottom of the screen when you select a unit.   	Name=Zipper;

SonarDistanceJam 	This is how far the unit jams sonar on the mini map. 	SonarDistanceJam=650;
sortbias 		sortbias=0;
SoundCategory 	The "sound category" the unit uses.   Sound categories are typically described in TDF files in the gamedata directory.  (The sounds.tdf file is a good place to start).  It is used to describe a group of sounds to associate with a unit, such as what sounds does it make when it starts, stops, arrives at a destination, is activated, is deactivated, etc. 	SoundCategory=VIPE;
SpanishDescription 	As description, in Spanish. 	SpanishDescription=VehÃ­culo todoterreno de ataque;
SpanishName 	As Name, but in Spanish 	SpanishName=Zipper;

Stealth 	Is this unit inivisible on sonar and radar. 	Stealth=1;
SteeringMode 	The way in which the unit turns. See totala1.hpi for options. 	SteeringMode=2;
TEDClass 	Important...I think. Define what type of unit it is. 	TEDClass=WATER;
teleporter 	Is this unit a teleporter. The two galatic gates have this = 1. 	teleporter=1;
ThreeD 	Is the unit 3D. 	ThreeD=1;
TidalGenerator 	Is the unit a Tidal generator? 	TidalGenerator=1;
TransMaxUnits 	Maximum number of units that can be transported. 	TransMaxUnits=1;
transportcapacity 	Like TransMaxUnits I guess. The number of units that can be transported. 	transportcapacity=5;
transportsize 	How big the transport is. I don't quite understand. 	transportsize=3;
TurnRate 	How quickly the unit turns. 	TurnRate=999;
UnitName 	The name of the files used for the unit? This is a unit ID.  This is the name of your unit, (what I refer to as the "short name" and the name your files you decided on. e.g.. your file in this case would be called coralpha.fbi.   	UnitName=CORWIN;
UnitNumber 	The ID\# for the unit. If this is the same as some other unit, your unit may not work.  Unique unit ID. VERY IMPORTANT. All IDs from 0-about 400 have been used. Use other ones > 10000 is the best. The more digits, the more unlikely you'll have a ID conflict with someone else.    	UnitNumber=9;
Upright 	Is the unit upright?  For kbots - this keeps the unit upgright when climbing hills.  In my case for a flying unit, my unit "layed down" on the ground whenever it landed (air unit).  By setting upright=1, it solved my problem. 	Upright=1;
Version 	The version of ta the unit will work under.   Do not be fooled. This is very important. It is version of TA under which the unit will run (beta 2 or whatever)   	Version=1;
WaterLine 	How high up the 3d model to put the water line. For ships. 	WaterLine=43;
Weapon1 	The unit's primary weapon.  The name specified is the name of a weapon described in any of the number of TDF files found in the weapon subdirectories. 	Weapon1=crblmssl;
Weapon2 	The unit's secondary weapon.  The name specified is the name of a weapon described in any of the number of TDF files found in the weapon subdirectories. 	Weapon2=coramph\_weapon2;
Weapon3 	The unit's third weapon.  The name specified is the name of a weapon described in any of the number of TDF files found in the weapon subdirectories. 	Weapon3=CORSEAP\_WEAPON3;
WindGenerator 	The amount of energy generated by the wind by the unit. 	WindGenerator=30;
WorkerTime 	How quickly the unit nanolathes. 	WorkerTime=80;
wpri\_badTargetCategory 	A bad target (lower chance of hitting) for the primary weapon.  The value specified identifies all units that have that value specified in their own "Category" settings. 	wpri\_badTargetCategory=VTOL;
wsec\_badTargetCategory 	A bad target for the secondry weapon. 	wsec\_badTargetCategory=VTOL;
YardMap 	Defines in more detail the "footprint" of a construction yard (or any stationary building).  As an example, the ARM Adv. Air Plant data at the right has 6 groups of 7 values defining an X-Z coordinate "footprint" for the construction yard.  The following values are available:
	"f" indicates the space is occupied by a feature (e.g. Dragons teeth)
	"o" indicates occupied points on ground where a unit may not pass.  By default, all values are "o".
	"O" - Occupied when building is open - never used.
	"c" defines the "hole" (typically in construction plant units) where the units are built and where they enter or exit.  closed yard - "Openyard/Closeyard" on land.
	"C" - closed yard - "Openyard/Closeyard" on water.
	"w" seems to indicate those parts of a ship yard that are above water
	"g" (or "G") indicates that the space can operate over a geothermal vent.   Otherwise, operates just like an "O".  Created specifically for the geothermal plant.
	"y" - standard yard - no footprint on land
	"Y" - standard water yard - no footprint on water.  "Y" is simply a location that will never have a footprint, no matter what.
As you know, footprints are square, but your units aren't always.
This allows you to shape the footprint a little.  (i.e. ARMLAB, the corners
are always "footprintless")

If the unit doesn't use "OpenYard"/"CloseYard" you can simply state "YardMap=o" no matter the size of the footprint.  You could also do the opposite by stating "YardMap=c", and the whole footprint will appear and disappear no matter the footprint size.
	// For ARM Adv. Air Plant
// FootprintX=7;
// FootprintZ=6;
YardMap=ooooooo ooooooo occccco occccco occccco occccco;
// Thus, the "South" end
// of the plant is open
// while the other sides
// are blocked.
ZBuffer 	Does the unit have a z buffer. (All units have this = 1) 	ZBuffer=1;
