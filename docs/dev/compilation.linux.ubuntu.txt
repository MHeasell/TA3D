Compilation under Ubuntu
=========================


1 - CMake
---------

You need CMake 2.6 in order to build TA3D. You can install it from the backports
repository (only 2.4 is in main). Enable hardy-backports, then use your favorite
package manager to install cmake 2.6

2 - GCC and required libraries
------------------------------

You need GCC with C++ support (g++) to build TA3D, just install g++ like any other
software using your package manager. Then you'll need to install the headers of
some libs :
	librandr-dev
	libsdl1.2-dev
	libsdl-image1.2-dev
	libsdl-net1.2dev
	libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

3 - FMOD
--------

FMOD is a sound/music library, there is no package for it so you'll have to download and install it
manually. You'll find it here:
www.fmod.org

we recommend you use the latest stable version (>= 4.16.x at the time of writing those instructions)

4 - TA3D
--------

Now you can build ta3d:
> cmake ./
> make
