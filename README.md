This is a work-in-progress fork of TA3D.
The objective is to create an open-source implementation
of the Total Annihilation engine that matches the look-and-feel
of the original and is highly compatible with existing mods, maps and units.
This fork officially supports Windows and Ubuntu.

## Installation

TA3D is just an engine and does nothing useful on its own.
You need to have Total Annihilation data files in order to play
(totala1.hpi, totala2.hpi, etc.).
On Ubuntu, place the data files in `~/.ta3d/resources`.
Windows instructions will appear here at a later date.

## Playing

On Ubuntu, to launch TA3D just run the command `ta3d` in your terminal.
Windows instructions will appear here at a later date.
